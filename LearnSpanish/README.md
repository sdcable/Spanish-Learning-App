#  Explanation of how I did

I really enjoyed working on this project. I think I managed my time well to be able to put forth an end product that I could be proud of. I feel like I knew the inuition of what I needed to do next in my app building process. I kenw generally how to style and how to work through some of the bugs I encountered.

I struggled to implement the MVVM framework. I made the mistake of putting everything into each individual view first, where I then thought it'd be easy to move it into the viewmodel. I made most of the model first, so implementing that and the getters and setters for the data there, but it's mostly the functions to get the flashcards and the quiz to work. I couldn't figure out in the time I had how to move it all into the viewmodel, which I know those should be in the viewmodel.
